1. Make dynamic categories page (template for image + score selecting + authors meme choice)
2. Submit scores for each user/category/meme
   - implement category checks
     - scores for all images? author image marked? all values unique (or go for normalized scores)? have all users voted?
3. Show only next category if previous one passed checks
4. Scoring code + page

Nice to have:

- Meme upload page
- dont add duplicate entries to IP2USER mapping
- offer list of registered users
- secretly save images of people so that we have a celebration page for the winner with the inserted picture

Nice to have, but very low priority:

- database instead of csv file (low priority)
