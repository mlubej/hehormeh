To start run:

```bash
flask --app main run --debug --host 0.0.0.0
```

1. Scoring code + page
   - do we really need a page for the score? It might be more dramatic to
   announce the winner via a cringe speach
2. Handle empty username
3. User pd.Dataframe to read/write to CSV files
4. Extend category eligibility check functionality to lock other category pages
   - unlock all when everything is finished
5. Meme upload page
6. auto create folders

Nice to have:

- dont add duplicate entries to IP2USER mapping
- offer list of registered users
- secretly save images of people so that we have a celebration page for the winner with the inserted picture
- page for trash/rejected memes
