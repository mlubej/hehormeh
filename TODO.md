1. Make dynamic categories page (template for image + score selecting + authors meme choice)
2. Submit scores for each user/category/meme
3. Show only next category if previous one passed checks
4. Scoring code + page

Nice to have:

- Meme upload page
- dont add duplicate entries to IP2USER mapping
- offer list of registered users
- database instead of csv file (low priority)
